# Javascript Demo App

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for developing and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

1. Youâ€™ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version.

### Installing

1. Clone repository

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:scope-demo-app/javascript-demo-app.git
```

2. Access the repository folder

```bash
$ cd javascript-demo-app
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Run locally

To run the web app locally:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

## Run tests

### Unit tests

To run unit tests:

```bash
$ yarn test:unit
```

### E2E tests

To run e2e tests you need to have the web app running in http://localhost:3000. When it is up and running simply run:

```bash
$ yarn test:e2e
```

## Report results to Scope

If you want to report your test results to Scope you need to run your tests with the `SCOPE_DSN` env variable. An option would be:

```bash
$ SCOPE_DSN=<your_namespace_dsn> yarn test:unit
```

or

```bash
$ SCOPE_DSN=<your_namespace_dsn> yarn test:e2e
```
